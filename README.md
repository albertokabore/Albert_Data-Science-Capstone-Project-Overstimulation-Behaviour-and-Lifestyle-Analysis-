Data Science Capstone Project: Overstimulation 
Behaviour and Lifestyle Analysis 

Project Overview 

Overstimulation has become a growing concern in today's digital world, where individuals are 
constantly exposed to excessive stimuli from social media, digital devices, and environmental factors. 

Understanding how overstimulation affects human behavior, mental health, and lifestyle can help in 
developing better intervention strategies. In this capstone project, students will analyze the 
Overstimulation Behavior and Lifestyle Dataset to uncover insights, trends, and patterns related to 
overstimulation and its impact on daily life.

Scenario 

A wellness research institute is studying the impact of overstimulation on human lifestyle and mental 
well-being. The institute aims to identify key factors contributing to overstimulation and provide 
recommendations for healthier digital habits. Your role as a data scientist is to analyze this dataset, 
identify patterns, and provide data-driven insights and recommendations. 
Problem Statements 

1. How does screen time correlate with cognitive fatigue and stress levels? 

2. What impact does social media usage have on mental health and work efficiency? 

3. Does physical activity play a role in reducing overstimulation effects? 

4. Are there significant differences in overstimulation scores based on demographic factors 

(age, gender)? 

5. How do sleep duration and multitasking habits contribute to cognitive fatigue? 

6. What lifestyle factors help in minimizing overstimulation? 

Project Deliverables 

1. Data Exploration & Cleaning 

• Load and clean the dataset (handle missing values, outliers, inconsistencies) 

• Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions 

• Visualize key trends using graphs and plots 

2. Statistical & Correlation Analysis

• Identify correlations between overstimulation score and other variables 

• Conduct hypothesis testing to validate key relationships 

3. Machine Learning Model  

• Train predictive models to estimate overstimulation scores based on lifestyle factors 

• Compare different models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) 

4. Insights & Recommendations 

• Summarize key findings with actionable insights 

• Propose recommendations for healthier lifestyle habits 

5. Final Report & Presentation 

• Document the entire process, methodology, and findings 

• Create a compelling presentation with visualizations 

• Provide a brief video or live presentation explaining key insights
